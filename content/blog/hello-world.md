This is a quick "hello world" from Real Bitcoin Fam to say, "We exist!" Or, at least, we are getting ready to exist.

Real Bitcoin Fam is a support network for Bitcoin, cryptocurrency and Web3 builders.

We welcome you no matter what chain you are building on and no matter what language you prefer. We welcome everyone whose building priorities are compatible with our vision of Bitcoin as a tool for mass access to prosperity.

## Benefits

By participating in Real Bitcoin Fam, or RBF, you can access the following benefits:

- exchange ideas with a community of like-minded builders
- find peers with whom to build together
- get mentoring on your building journey
- get support as you build
- get exposed to new ideas and trends in the Web3 world
- rest assured of active moderation that ensures a positive, productive and safe community for you.

RBF is, first and foremost, a supportive and positive community of peers who make a solemn commitment to supporting each other during the arduous journeys we are each undertaking to build something in the Web3 space.

RBF is not the arm of any particular blockchain, cryptocurrency, corporation or venture capital fund. RBF is a mission-oriented and values-first space that is blockchain-agnostic. We welcome everyone who finds something agreeable in our vision or approach to building. We welcome non-exclusive partnerships with any ethical entity in our industry.

The crypto space can be a cutthroat arena where sometimes it looks like 80% of the activity is ethically questionable. RBF aims to be part of that 20% that has an 80%-level impact for honoring and building the OG Bitcoin vision of a world where all have access to sound money and a chance at prosperity.

RBF places ethics, mission, vision and values first, before profit.
